Dicerooms
Dice Poker Club has a special zone of 6 areas, all of which represent each face of the dice. Each of these faces is full of casinos divided into Dicerooms. These casinos are evenly distributed, so each face has the same number of casinos and Dicerooms.
Stats of the Dicerooms
Dicerooms inside the casinos are of six different types: Small Diceroom, Saloon Diceroom, Mid Diceroom, Big Diceroom, Tournament Diceroom, and VIP Diceroom.
The difference between each type of Diceroom lies mostly in its size and, therefore, the capacity to receive players. Saloons are specialized and have only one type of Diceroom. In the following chart are the capacity stats of each Diceroom according to its type.
| Type            | Player Capacity |
| ---             | ---             |
| Small Diceroom   | 10              |
| Saloon Diceroom | 25              |
| Mid Diceroom    | 50              |
| Big Diceroom     | 100             |
| Tournament Diceroom  | 200             |
| VIP Diceroom         | 1000            |

How Diceroom works:
Dicerooms are a very important part of the game. Every PvP game, regardless of the event or mode, is played inside a Diceroom.
Their owners can use them to organize their events. It is also possible to offer different PvP game configurations than the standard ones. This feature is just one of all the customization options you can access.
Once you buy a Diceroom, they will have only the needed furniture to play standard PvP games (fast) that help stands up. To unlock more features, you will have to improve the Diceroom by adding more accessories such as chairs.
For example, chairs are needed for longer events so the players can wait seated for their turn to play.
Of course, you can also improve its visual appearance to look like a real game room over time. Later in the project, we will provide information about other specific features that users will be able to take advantage of.
Managers
Owners of Dicerooms equal to more than 50% of a casino can become Managers. The Federation can only give this responsibility or “Title.”
The administrators are responsible for keeping the casino working all the time and, at the same time, gaining visibility in or out of the game. This feature allows the creation of Private Clubs, where the players will be organized as a community.
Both owning Dicerooms and becoming an Administrator (Manager) of a casino give the chances to new opportunities and rewards to the players.
If you only own one Diceroom, it will provide daily earnings through the games played in it. Thus, if there is a possibility to organize your events to attract players, imagine the possibilities this would bring along! The Federation will pay extra bonuses to the best Mangers as a reward.
Dicerooms will add features and functionality to the game that you may not have seen before in a Play to Earn game.
