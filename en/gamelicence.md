# **Game License**

Have you already formed your team? Then it's time to play! But first, **get your Game License**.
## **General**

Gaming Licenses are a necessary condition to play. Once a team is formed, it must be under an active license before being able to access any game mode.
## **Duration and cost of licenses**

The **Game Licenses** duration will be variable, and the player is free to choose which one he wants to activate for each team.

- **The Daily License** allows you to make changes to your team with this frequency. The cost will be higher than the rest, but it will enable you to keep your equipment updated. Recommended for players with good performance.
- **The Weekly License** allows you to extend its validity to 7 days to make changes to your equipment with this frequency. The cost is lower than the daily one and will enable you to pool resources to make better upgrades.
- **The Fortnightly License** extends the possibility of keeping your team in play for up to 15 days. Its cost is less than weekly. It is perfect for players starting with little investment as it allows you to save and accumulate resources to make more relevant upgrades to your team.
- **The Monthly License** extends your team's participation in the game to 30 days. It is the lowest cost per day license in the game and can become the most profitable if your equipment no longer needs upgrades or you need to gather many resources to upgrade it.

>ðŸ’¡ It is necessary to activate a license for each team you want to start, but their frequencies and costs are independent, thus allowing you to plan different strategies for each of your groups.
## **How the Gaming License works**

Game licenses, once activated, become a source of renewal of the **Rewards Pool.**

Teams under a license are **BLOCKED** for the license duration, allowing the player only to make repairs. No further modification will be possible without first cancelling the current permit.

>ðŸ’¡ Canceling the license does not require any additional payment as part of the game, but the Blockchain requires a small GAS to make this modification.

The **Game License** can be cancelled, but with its early closure, the cost previously paid for its activation is forfeited. For this reason, we recommend using licenses depending on the state of our equipment. Ex: If the equipment is about to be upgraded, choose a short-term license.

The features of your teams will not be activated until the team is under a license. **Energy** from an unlicensed team will not allow you to play more games.
