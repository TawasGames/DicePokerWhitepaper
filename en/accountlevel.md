# **Peculiarity of the account**

We want to give an additional push to the most regular players of Dice Poker Club, creating a reward system based on their achievements. The goal is to gain the largest quantity of possible points to increase the category (peculiarity) of the account. 
## **Generality:**

When increasing the category of your account, some advantages will come along. Firstly, some basic rewards have been thought to be implemented, but there are also several different rewards for the near future. All of them available from day one will be:
-a raise the earnings obtained in the game.
-access to special events
-unlocking or obtention of the NFT
Of course, these advantages will be leveraged not negatively to affect the game's environment. Plus, they will be regulated by the Oracle and the administrators.

## **Rarities and achievement system:**

To unlock achievements and thus accumulate points, there is only one way to do it: to play Dice Poker Club. **Several achievements have been created to reach every aspect of the game, so a bigger number of users make use of them.**
To increase the rarity of your account (upgrade), you need to accumulate two different types of points. Upgrading to the next level will require a certain number of points for both classes; it is not automatic to elevate the category; the player will have to claim it to make it happen.
