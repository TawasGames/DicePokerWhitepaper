## PvP Mode
Welcome to the **Dice Poker Club PvP Mode**. In this modality, as its name indicates, you will face other players in exciting games of different types.
> Not all PvP features will be released initially, but we will update periodically.

## PvP Mode Overview

The basic game rules are the same as in PvE. All your games are played in Dicerooms, even if you don't own one yet. The system will randomly match you with a rival if you wish. In case you want to challenge a specific player, you can do that too.

In PvP matches, the rewards are provided by the organizers. Before starting a game, players must choose the amount they wish to bet. By default they have 3 options to choose from, but it will be possible to agree on a specific number of tokens.

## Future Updates:

In its beginnings, the game will only feature Duels, a classic 1vs1 confrontation mode. With the updates, new modes will be added so that up to 10 players can participate simultaneously. Team modes will also be added, to play 2vs2 and 3vs3.

The Leagues and Tournaments options will be introduced in a special update. Players who own Dicerooms will be able to independently organize Tournaments, where they can set the prize, decide the format and even modify the rules of the game.

The possible modifications can be, to cite some examples, modifying the victory condition in the games, reducing the number of throws and rounds, or the points that the faces of the dice contribute, among others.

## Other possible variations:

- Only Red scores (red colored faces) or conversely only Black scores (black colored faces)
- Only score 1 face out of 6.
- Variants of the previous ones to 1 roll.
- Variants of the previous single round (3 rolls)
- Score in order. An order is chosen to score in each round.
