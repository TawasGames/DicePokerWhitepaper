# Gameplay

**Dice Poker** is a fairly simple dice game, as it is based on the popular card game ‚ÄúPOKER‚Äù. Its learning curve is even lower since the Combinations that score the best is only six and can only be achieved with figures of the same type and Aces üî¥. Below are the rules of the game.

## **General rules:**

The game‚Äôs goal is to get the highest possible score in each round, and whoever accumulates the most points at the end will win.
- In the standard game mode, there are six rounds, one for each face of the die.
- It is played with five dice thrown a maximum of 3 times per turn.
- To get a high score, you must accumulate the largest number of dice with the same symbol.
- Aces üî¥ are considered wild cards and can be added to any other set and add up as such.
- In each turn, the dice are thrown a maximum of 3 times.
- You can decide to reserve any amount of dice (demo video)
- Dice are reserved until the three regulatory rolls are made.
- Reserved dice are not rolled on subsequent rolls unless you complete a set of 5 and still have rolls left. Re-rolling your group of 5 is called doubling down.
- Doubling is a special move that allows you to re-roll reserved dice after reaching five dice of one type. It only activates if you still have any rolls left. If at least 1 of the dice lands on the completed option, it is added; otherwise, the entire roll is lost.
- In each turn, a face is scored, and the one you choose will define your score for the round. Choose wisely and trust your ability. A face that has already been scored cannot be repeated.
## **Values ‚Äã‚Äãof faces and proportions per round:**

Each face (figure) of the dice is assigned a score ranging from 1 to 6 points, with **As** being the highest value and **9** the lowest.

In each round, the objective is to obtain the greatest number of points possible by assigning the final result of the three rolls to one of the six spaces corresponding to each of the six faces.

The more faces of the same type we assign to the space coinciding with the ‚Äúfigure‚Äù of this face, the higher the score.

Once you have filled in the space corresponding to a face (scored), you will not be able to replace this score; keep this factor in mind for your dice in the following rounds.

- The **As** has a value of 6 points, and the maximum score you can obtain with them is 30, assigning a throw of 5 **Ases to the space of the Ace.**
- The **K** has a value of 5 points, and the maximum score you can obtain with them is 25, assigning a throw of 5 **Ks** or **Aces (wildcards) to the space of the K. **
- The **Q** has a value of 4 points, and the maximum score you can obtain with them is 20, assigning a roll of 5 **Qs** or **Aces (wildcards) to the space of the Q. **
- The **J** has a value of 3 points, and the maximum score you can obtain with them is 15, assigning a roll of 5 **Js** or **Aces (wildcards) to the space of the Jack. **
- The **10** has a value of 2 points, and the maximum score you can obtain with them is 10, assigning a roll of 5 **10s** or **Aces (wildcards) to the space of 10.* *
- The **9** has a value of 1 point, and the maximum score you can obtain with them is 5, assigning a roll of 5 **9s** or **Aces (wildcards) to the nine space. **
## **Use of Cups and Dice:**

At the beginning of each game, the user chooses the Cup that he will use to play from 3 random options. You can strategically change the Cup at the start of each round.

Depending on the Cup in use, they are the Dice Packs that will come out on the table with each roll. If the Dice Pack and the Cup match in quality, the player earns +1 ‚Äútiebreaker points‚Äù.

## **Tiebreaker Rules:**

Rule # 1: In the case of a tie, the ‚Äútiebreaker points‚Äù will be used to break it. If the tie persists, Rule # 2 is evaluated.

Rule #2: An additional round is played (Sudden Death). If the tie persists, Rule #1 is evaluated.

Rule #3: If there is a Ruby or Diamond quality account among the tied players, it automatically wins the match without evaluating Rule #1.

Rule # 4: If both tied players have Ruby or Diamond quality accounts, Rule # 1 is evaluated.
