Dice Packs
Dice Packs are one of the NFTs needed to create a team to play in Dice Poker Club. You will need at least 1 Pack of basic quality (Plastic) to initiate. You can get these by opening boxes or buying them from other players in the marketplace.
Dice Pack will have four different characteristics, each with a given role in the game.
The stats are Poker Skill (PSK), Energy (E), Durability (D), and Upgrade Potential (UP).

PSK
This stat is on every dice in the pack. The sum of this stat defines the final count of PSK your Dice Pack will have.
PSK is variable. Every quality has ranks of PSK. You will be able to see this data on the stats chart later.
The PSK will limit the level you can get in PvE mode. This doesnâ€™t mean you can go straight to the final permitted level; before that, you have to undergo through every level, starting from the first.

Energy
This stat is on every dice in the pack. The average of this stat defines the final count of Energy your Dice Pack will have.
The Energy is fixed. Every quality has a specific amount of Energy. You will be able to see this data in the stats chart later.
The Energy will limit the number of games you can participate in a day, both PvP and PvE mode. At the same time, the Energy your Pack Dice can be limited by the Shaker related to the team you created. Further data in Shaker.

Durability
This stat is on every dice in the pack. The sum of this stat defines the final count of Durability your Dice Pack will have.
Durability is fixed. Every quality has a specific amount of Durability. You will be able to see this data in the stat chart later.
Durability will be spent on every throw of the game, but there will be a time the user will have to repair his dice to keep playing. It will also be possible to boost it to expand the uses of your **Dice pack strategically.**


Improvement Potential
This is a special stat and can be found on every dice of the pack. The average of this stat defines the final count of Improvement Potential your Dice Pack will have.
The Improvement Potential is variable. Every quality has Improvement Potential Ranks. You will be able to see this data in the Improvement Potential Chart later.
The Improvement Potential will allow us to upgrade the rest of the stats for 24h. You will be able to do as many upgrades as many Power Slots the Shaker(s) has on the created team. Further data in Shakers.
