# Accessories

Accessories are a special add-on at **Dice Poker Club**. We will implement two types of accessories: **NFT and non-NFT**.
NFT-type accessories will be unique, without repetitions in or out of the game.
Non-NFT accessories will be in common use and available to all players. Its relevance is in the direct influence it will have on the gameplay of Dice Poker Club.
