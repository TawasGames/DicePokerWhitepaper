# Teams

To play **Dice Poker Club** you must have at least one active team. Below we give you all the information about them.

## **Team building:**

Teams are created from the combination of Dice Packs and Cups. **All your Packs and Cups are eligible to form a Team**.

Teams are formed based on a cup, and Packs are added depending on the Pack Capacity stat. For each Cup you add, you will increase the number of Packs you can associate.

**You can add only a maximum of 5 Cups per team, and each dice pack is associated with a specific Cup.**

### **Activation:**

Before its activation, you will be able to make all the modifications that you consider necessary until you are satisfied with your equipment.

To activate an already formed team is only necessary to pay for a license of any type. To be able to make changes again, you must cancel the license that activated it. For more details visit [License](/diceteam.md).
### **Functioning:**

The equipment can be catalogued in a summarized way as a set of NFTs (Pack of Dice and Cups) under license.

You can play as many games as Energy and add up all the active teams you keep. As you use them, their Energy will deplete, and you will have to switch to the next one.

You will be able to play as far in PvE Mode as Poker Skill has the equipment in use. The Poker Skill of your dice is not consumed; instead, the durability is.

If the durability of any pack of your teams reaches zero, the stats are unusable, but you can continue playing as many times and as far as the remaining Packs allow. Keep this in mind, and repair your most worn Packs whenever you get the chance.
